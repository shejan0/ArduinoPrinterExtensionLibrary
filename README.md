# Arduino Basic Printing Library

Basic Arduino 1.5 Compatible Library meant to teach Arduino users how to make pre-compiled libraries (.a archives) for commercial or abstracted usage.



(Includes precompiled version for ATMega328p, ATMega2560, ATMega168, and ATMega32u4 boards)



The complete instructional that I wrote is available [here](BuildingPrecompiledArduinoLibrary-Shejan.pdf)
